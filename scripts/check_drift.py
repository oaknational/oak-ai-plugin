"""Alarm when a published plugin falls behind its source repository.

For each publish in PROVENANCE.json, fetches the source repository's
current plugin manifest from its default branch and compares versions.
A mismatch means the ecosystem has released a plugin version this
repository doesn't publish yet — run the "Sync plugin from the
ecosystem" workflow to catch up.

Run weekly by CI (the "Publish drift" workflow), whose failure is the
alarm: issues are off here by design, so a red scheduled run notifying
the repository's watchers is the signal. Version-only on purpose: the
fidelity check already proves the copy matches its pinned commit, and
the ecosystem bumps the manifest version whenever the plugin changes.

Run it locally the same way: python3 scripts/check_drift.py
