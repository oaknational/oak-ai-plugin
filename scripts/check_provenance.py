"""Prove each published plugin is a faithful copy of its recorded source.

PROVENANCE.json records, for every plugin copy this repository publishes,
the source repository, the commit the copy was taken from, the paths left
out of the copy and any known, explained divergences. This script checks
that every plugin the marketplace publishes has a provenance entry, clones
each entry's source at its recorded commit (sparse and blobless, so it is
quick) and compares the trees file by file. Any differing, missing or
extra file that is not excluded or recorded as a known divergence fails
the check, as does a plugin manifest whose version differs from the
recorded one.

The comparison walks both trees in Python rather than parsing `git diff`
output: --no-index reports one-sided files as /dev/null and C-quotes
unusual names, both of which are easy to mishandle silently.

Run by CI (the "Sync fidelity" job); needs network access. Run it locally
the same way: python3 scripts/check_provenance.py
