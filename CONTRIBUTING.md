# Contributing

Thank you for taking an interest in Oak's AI plugins. This repository publishes
the plugins so that anyone can read and install them, but the ways to
contribute differ depending on whether you work at Oak National Academy.

## Are pull requests accepted?

**Not from outside Oak National Academy.** This repository only holds published
copies. The plugins are written and tested in
[oak-open-curriculum-ecosystem](https://github.com/oaknational/oak-open-curriculum-ecosystem),
next to the Oak Curriculum MCP server they connect to, and each release is
copied here. A change made here would be overwritten by the next copy, so we are
not able to review or merge external pull requests, and we would rather say so
plainly than leave one sitting unanswered.

## What feedback is most useful

We very much want to hear from people using the plugins. The most useful things
you can tell us are:

- **Wrong or unhelpful answers** — a skill or workflow that gave an answer that
  was wrong, out of date or not useful. Say what you asked, what you got, and
  what you expected.
- **Curriculum problems** — a lesson, unit or misconception the plugin reported
  that looks wrong or incomplete.
- **Installation problems** — the plugin not installing, not loading, or not
  connecting to the Oak Curriculum MCP.
- **Gaps** — something you expected the plugin to help with that it doesn't.
- **Documentation that is wrong or unclear** — including anything in this
  repository.

## How to send feedback

Use the AI plugin feedback form:

**<https://survey.hsforms.com/2vy6BnIvzTASqx1DbH8CaJAbvumd>**

GitHub issues are turned off on this repository, so the form is the route that
reaches the team. See [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) for what is in scope and how
quickly you can expect a reply.

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through the form.** Follow
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead.

## Code of conduct

Everyone interacting with this project, including through the feedback form, is
expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## For Oak engineers

1. Change a plugin in oak-open-curriculum-ecosystem, raise its version and add a
   changelog entry there.
2. Once that is released, copy the plugin here with the **Sync plugin from the
   ecosystem** workflow, giving it the release's ref. It copies the plugin
   without the `evals/` folders, records the source in
   [PROVENANCE.json](PROVENANCE.json) and adds an entry to
   [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Until the workflow can open pull requests
   itself, open one from the branch it pushes.
3. Open a pull request against `main`. Its title is a
   [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with the ticket at
   the end when there is one, because pull requests are squash-merged and the title becomes the
   commit on `main`. It needs the required checks and an approving review before
   it can merge. The checks are described in
   [.github/workflows/README.md](.github/workflows/README.md).
4. To run the same checks locally before each commit, install
   [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) and the hooks once, as the README
   describes.
